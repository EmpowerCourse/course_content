          <h1>Course Code of Conduct</h1>
          <p>
            All participants, instructors, assistants, sponsors, and volunteers in the course are required to agree with the following code of conduct.
            Organizers will enforce this code throughout the course. We are expecting cooperation from all participants to help ensuring a safe environment for everybody.
          </p>

          <h2>Need Help?</h2>
          <p>You have our contact details in the emails we&#39;ve sent.</p>

          <h2>The Quick Version</h2>
          <p>The Empower course is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices.
            We do not tolerate harassment of course participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any course venue, including talks, workshops, parties, or online media.
            Course participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the course at the discretion of the course organizers.</p>

          <h2>The Less Quick Version</h2>
          <p>Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, technology choices, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.</p>
          <p>Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.</p>
          <p>Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualized images, activities, or other material. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualized clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualized environment.</p>
          <p>If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the course organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the course.</p>
          <p>If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of course staff immediately.</p>
          <p>Course staff will be happy to help participants contact security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the course. We value your attendance.</p>
          <p>We expect participants to follow these rules at course venues and any course-related social events.</p>
